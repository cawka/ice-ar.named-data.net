Technological advances have moved the society into an exciting wireless mobile computing era, where people's daily life is enhanced by new applications of ever increasing sophistication. However today's Internet operates using the TCP/IP protocol architecture that was developed 40 years ago, which limits the utilization of these technology advances to their full potential. In this project we propose to remove the architectural limitations by applying the results from our six-year research efforts on Named Data Networking,  a realization of the Information Centric Networking (ICN) vision, to develop a new wireless network architecture.

To place our efforts on solid ground, our team, composed of experts in Named Data Networking, applications, wireless, security and privacy, and hardware acceleration proposes to design, develop, and experiment with new applications to push the frontier of wireless edge deployment using NDN. We choose two distinct application scenarios for a large university campus to motivate the need for our research and demonstrate our proposed architecture's scalability.  The first scenario aims to enable the authoring and experience of rich augmented reality (AR) by members and visitors of a campus community, using NDN to leverage high performance wireless technology and edge computing capabilities, and to support expressive and realistic trust mechanisms.  The second scenario addresses disaster recovery challenges, such as after a large scale earthquake that may disrupt power supplies and damage network infrastructure. Under such adverse conditions our goal is to enable first responders from multiple agencies to collaboratively assess and respond to the situation in real-time, using diverse applications including AR, to assist the campus community with up-to-date information and evacuation efforts.

However the AR implementations with TCP/IP today resort to cloud services, which lead to scalability and performance concerns and unavailability after disasters.  We believe that NDN can enable AR at wireless edge through systematic naming and retrieving named data at network layer. NDN design principles emphasize application-level data naming and data-centric security, asynchronous publishing and consumption, and enable efficient use of local and proximate resources.  We will apply them to build a system that unifies the latest advances in wireless communication with domain specific computing technologies to accelerate AR at wireless edge and deliver robust performance for large groups of people interacting in real-time with data and content.


## OUR MISSION

- <span class="dropcap dropcap-big">R</span>  Realize ICN in an operational demonstration system that integrates low-level wireless performance improvements with domain-specific acceleration 
as a service --- exploring the design and usage of computation at wireless edge.

- <span class="dropcap dropcap-big">I</span> Investigate the design of robust and resilient networking for an information system that comprehensively utilizes infrastructure resources 
as well as withstands massive infrastructure failures.

- <span class="dropcap dropcap-big">D</span> Develop approaches that transition content delivery from monolithic, context-independent streams to highly granular, context-dependent approaches that can adapt rapidly and be delivered efficiently.

- <span class="dropcap dropcap-big">I</span> Investigate management of identities and trust relations in dense deployments in large campus networks of the future where content can be generated  by all edge devices. 

- <span class="dropcap dropcap-big">E</span>Explore how to infuse comprehensive end-to-end security and identity privacy protection for users/applications--intrinsic security and privacy in all cyberspace elements at the edge, rather than an after-thought patch-on.
