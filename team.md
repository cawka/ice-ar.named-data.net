    info: "Mario Gerla holds the Engineering degree from the Politecnico di Milano, Italy and the Ph.D. degree from UCLA. He became IEEE Fellow in 2002. As a Graduate Student at UCLA, he was part of the team that worked on the early ARPA Network system and protocols under the guidance of Prof. Leonard Kleinrock. After four years at Network Analysis Corporation in NY, he joined the UCLA Faculty in 1976. At UCLA he has designed network protocols including ad hoc wireless clustering, multicast (ODMRP and CODECast) and Internet transport (TCP Westwood). He has lead the ONR MINUTEMAN project, designing the next generation scalable airborne Internet for tactical and homeland defense scenarios. He is now leading several advanced wireless network projects under Industry and Government funding. His team is developing a Vehicular Testbed for safe navigation, content distribution, urban sensing and intelligent transport. Parallel research activities are wireless medical monitoring using smart phones and cognitive radios in urban environments. He has served on several Conference Program Committees including MobiCom, MobiHoc, MedHocNet and WONS. He is on the IEEE TON Scientific Advisory Board."
